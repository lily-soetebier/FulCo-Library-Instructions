# FulCo-Library-Instructions
This repo contains a task oriented DITA topic model for a potential instructional page for signing up for a Fulton County Library card. All of the information contained within the repository has been sourced from the Fulton County Library website.

## From PDF to DITA
The original version of these instructions, found in [Soetebier_Instructions](Soetebier_Instructions.pdf), was created in Canva. By translating this instruction set from a static PDF into a topic model I was able to refine the content and make it easier to update and reuse.

## Maps
There are four total maps for this topic model:

- [m_new_user](m_new_user.ditamap)
- [m_card_management](m_card_management.ditamap)
- [m_faq](m_faq.ditamap)
- [m_combined_map](m_combined_map.ditamap)
  
The first three maps could be used as standalone instruction sets. The fourth map, as the name implies, stitches together the three other maps to create a comprehensive guide that mimics the structure of the original instruction set.

## Outputs
In the [output](output) folder there is a styled PDF of each map. The style sheet, [pdf_theme](pdf_theme.yaml) provides some basic formatting and color for visual interest.

The font required to run the yaml styling as intended is Bahnschrift, which is available by default on Windows machines.
